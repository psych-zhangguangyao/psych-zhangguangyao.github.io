I am a Posdoc researcher at Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China, collaborating with Prof. Yanchao Bi. I completed my PhD in June 2022 at the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the guidance of Prof. Nan Lin. My academic journey began with a BS degree from Nankai University in June 2017, under the guidance of Prof. Hull Chen.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on the intersection of cognitive science and neuroscience, 
employing multidisciplinary approaches including behavioral experiments, fMRI, and computational modeling 
to investigate the cognitive, neural, and computational mechanisms underlying conceptual processing and learning during social and linguistic interactions. 
This work aims to elucidate the cognitive foundations of key processes like "social conceptual processing" and "conceptual learning".
