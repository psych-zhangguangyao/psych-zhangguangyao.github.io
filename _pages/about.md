I am a Posdoc researcher at Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China, collaborating with Prof. Yanchao Bi. I completed my PhD in June 2022 at the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the guidance of Prof. Nan Lin. My academic journey began with a BS degree from Nankai University in June 2017.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on the intersection of cognitive science and neuroscience, 
employing a variety of methodological approaches such as behavioral experiments, fMRI, and computational modeling to investigate the cognitive, neural, and computational mechanisms underlying conceptual processing and learning in social and linguistic interactions. 
Through a technical roadmap that involves "identifying brain regions—establishing connections—constructing models", my work aims to unveil the cognitive mechanisms of critical processes such as "social conceptual processing" and "conceptual learning", thereby providing theoretical support for the development and optimization of relevant large-scale AI models.
